# euclid
Interactive calculation of the greatest common factor of two numbers, using Euclid's algorithm.

The MVP release features some hand-coded display, the most showy of which is a grid illustrating how a tiler can use Euclid’s Algorithm to calculate the largest tile that can be used to tile a rectangular room: the display shows, in different colors, how the size was determined, and uses dotted outlines to demonstrate how the tiles would fit into the rectangle.

The page includes a modal, using Bootstrap, to pop out a description of the algorithm, and how it can be applied to a tiler’s work. I’ve also used Less for styling.
